# What does multi-tenant mean to us?

1. Users can belong to an organization.
2. We can have multiple organizations in the same loopback server/db.
3. Any data created for the organization or any data created by the users of that organization should be segragated from the the users of another organization.
4. If we want, we should be able to configure the users that belong to the same organization to view any data that other users of that organization created.

## Assumptions

1. A `sysAdmin` like role for access over REST is unnecessary when compared to the security threat it poses. One can always SSH into the server directl and use something like `loopback-console` instead for `sysAdmin` purposes. Possibly exposing some kind of server-side-only impersonation API would make it even more useful.
2. Currently there aren't any known use cases which merit exposing `TeamModel` over REST and given how it would complicate the ACLs a lot when attempting to prevent REST~ful users from adding themselves to other teams ... its just better to keep `TeamModel` at server-side-only.

## Improvements

* Instead of saving role as-is into `TeamModel` when provided by a restful client, some sort of validation against pre-seeded `Role`s should be performed.

## High-Level Implementation Details

1. A user signup *should* always create a new organization and new team entry to track the user as the organization's administrator (`orgAdmin`).
  1. The `create` method for `UserModel` is overridden so that the server-side is responsible for creating an `OrgModel` and doesn't trust the client to do so when a user signs up.
  2. The `after save` hook on `UserModel` is used to tie together a newly created user with an organization and a role by creating a new entry in `TeamModel`.

## Test Heroku deployment

* https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-button#testing-the-app-json-file
  * I named it `multi-tenant-loopback-example` when I went through the process, you can name it something else: https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/ShoppinPal/multi-tenant-loopback-example/tree/master
* Tail heroku logs: `heroku logs -t -a multi-tenant-loopback-example` ... the app name like I said was set to `multi-tenant-loopback-example` by me but you may choose anything else.
